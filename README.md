# Competitive Programming Study

## About

This repository is my desperate attempt at learning C++ in under a month for competitive programming.
I am going to participate in the OBI (Olimpíada Brasileira de Informática), and for that competition I need to be fast.

    And we all know, python is the best language for speed!

So for that reason I need to learn C++ and learn Competitive Programming, I have another repository on C data structures which I will be completing using the Free Code Camp 9 hour youtube Course

I am doing 10 hour study sessions in order to get a good grasp of the entire language

This repository focuses on the main STL properties that i will need in order to write fast and good code on the competition

I used the google docs presentation done by Utkarsh Gupta because written docs are better than videos for me, link to the presentation:
